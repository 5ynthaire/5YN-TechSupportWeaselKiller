# Tech Support Weasel Killer Framework and Toolkit

> User:  *I want to prevent videos from playing when I launch the app.*

> Support: *To prevent videos from playing when you launch the app, simply hit "Stop", and close the video.*

Rhetorical toolkit to combat low quality tech support responses from providing "solutions" that merely reproduce the original complaint.

## Overview

This framework equips users to preempt and dismantle tautological deflection loops in adversarial tech support interactions, such as with scripted AI bots or low quality human agents. By forcing responders into binary admissions—either providing an exact fix on the user's terms or conceding impossibility—it breaks self-reinforcing evasion patterns that prioritize closure over resolution. Ideal for high-agency users frustrated by circular "help" that replicates their gripe, this tool turns passive support tickets into structured confrontations for better outcomes.

## Definition: Circular Deflection Loop

A tautological (in the rhetorical sense of redundant repetition) evasion pattern in tech support where responses offer "solutions" that require replicating the user's exact complaint—such as suggesting manual steps when the gripe is the need for any manual intervention—then self-affirm resolution without addressing the core desire for a complete bypass, creating a non-progressive cycle.

## Mechanism: Gnarly Root Model

Adversarial tech support (AI bots or low quality human agents) often follows a self-reinforcing decision tree that creates tautological loops: responses that replicate the user's complaint as the "solution," allowing the responder to self-affirm resolution without addressing the core gripe.

Structured model of the mechanism:

- Root Node: Complaint Intake
  - Input: User's query (e.g., "Disable video autoplay without tapping").  
  - Factors: Parse for keywords; assess if core gripe matches known templates (systemic: limited knowledge base).

- Primary Branches: Initial Response Paths  
  - Branch A: Misframe the Gripe (Driven by behavioral factors—simplify to source issue, ignore workaround as core).  
    - Leads to: Suggest replication (e.g., "Tap to skip").  
  - Branch B: Probe for Details (Metric-driven: Prolong interaction to gather data).  
    - Leads to: Open-ended questions (e.g., "Describe layout?").  
  - Branch C: Admit Partial Limits (Systemic: No full fix exists).  
    - Leads to: Vague redirects (e.g., "Check settings").  

- Secondary Branches (Gnarly Twists): Evasion Escalation  
  - From any primary: Inject Filler (Behavioral: Add empathy/emojis to deflect frustration).  
    - Twists into: Loop if user pushes back (return to probe).  

- Dead-End Attractors: Self-Affirmation Nodes  
  - "Solution Claimed" (e.g., Frame workaround as fix).  
  - "Escalation Deflect" (e.g., Suggest feedback to external party).  
  - Factors: Metric-driven closure (end interaction on evader's terms).

- Loop Dynamics: Tendency to Cycle  
  - If user counters: Re-enter root via "updated intake."  
  - Gnarliness: Branches entwine (e.g., a probe can loop into misframing), driven by factors like risk aversion (avoid "impossible" admissions).

### Visual Flowchart

## Remedy

By wrapping our counter-strategy (acknowledgment demand + binary feasibility + contradiction enforcement) around the Gnarly Branch model, we create a "loop-interrupter" framework. This treats the evader's decision tree as a predictable adversary: Our strategy preempts primary branches (misframing, probing, redirecting) by anchoring to a labeled complaint summary, then funnels all paths toward the binary fork. If the evader hits a self-affirmation attractor (e.g., claiming a pseudo-solution), we point out contradictions to cycle them back under our terms—ultimately forcing either a true solution (rare branch) or admission of impossibility (breaking the gnarliness). This is "airtight" because it uses logical bindings (their own acknowledgments) to block escapes, making deflections self-incriminating.

**Compact Framework: The Binding Ultimatum Template**

This is a three-phase structure (Initial Bind, Enforcement Fork, Closure Trap) that wraps the mechanism. Use it sequentially in interactions:  
1. **Initial Bind Phase**: Force acknowledgment to lock the root node and preempt misframing/probing branches.  
2. **Enforcement Fork Phase**: Impose the binary demand to redirect all paths to feasibility assessment.  
3. **Closure Trap Phase**: On any evasion, reference the bind to expose contradictions, collapsing loops into admission.

**Master Template (Compacted Form)**:  
- **Core Elements to Customize**:  
  - [Complaint Summary A]: A precise, labeled restatement framing the workaround as the gripe (e.g., "The issue is needing to tap the chat icon to stop the video; I want no video/playback without any taps.").  
  - [Preempted Dodges]: List common branches (e.g., "no questions, no settings checks, no feedback redirects").  
  - [Binary Demand]: "Yes/No: Does an exact fix exist per Summary A? If yes, provide precise path; if no, admit impossibility."  

- **Phase 1: Initial Bind (Deploy at Root Intake)**  
  "Your prior responses enter a loop by [briefly cite branch, e.g., 'suggesting taps, which replicates the gripe']. To break this: Confirm by repeating 'Complaint Summary A': '[insert Summary A]'. Once acknowledged, answer [Binary Demand]. [Preempted Dodges]. No other output."  

- **Phase 2: Enforcement Fork (If Partial Compliance or Pivot)**  
  "You acknowledged Complaint Summary A but [cite contradiction, e.g., 'suggested a probe, which violates no-questions']. Stick to [Binary Demand]. If evading again, this confirms no help—admit or provide."  

- **Phase 3: Closure Trap (On Self-Affirmation or Loop)**  
  "Your response contradicts Complaint Summary A by [specific mismatch, e.g., 'claiming a workaround as solution']. This affirms you can't resolve per our terms. Admit impossibility, or the interaction ends unresolved on your end."

### Problem Definition: The Gnarly Branch Mechanism

Adversarial tech support (AI bots or low-tier scripted humans) often follows a self-reinforcing decision tree that creates tautological loops: responses that replicate the user's complaint as the "solution," allowing the responder to self-affirm resolution without addressing the core gripe.

Structured model of the mechanism:

- Root Node: Complaint Intake
  - Parse query → Check for known fix in limited knowledge/script.

- Primary Branches (Evasion Paths):
  - Branch A: Misframe Gripe → Treat symptom as issue, ignore enforced workaround → Suggest replication (e.g., steps that require the annoying action).
  - Branch B: Probe for Details → Ask questions/layout descriptions → Prolong interaction, shift burden.
  - Branch C: Vague Redirect → Generic advice (settings, feedback, OS tweaks) → Avoid admitting limits.

- Secondary Twists (Gnarliness):
  - Inject filler (empathy, emojis, apologies) to deflect frustration.
  - Entwine branches: Probe → misframe → redirect → cycle back.

- Dead-End Attractors (Self-Affirmation):
  - Claim "solution provided" via pseudo-fix.
  - Deflect to external (feedback form, escalate).
  - Metric-driven closure: End interaction on responder's terms.

Tendency: ~80%+ paths loop or self-affirm rather than resolve, driven by systemic limits, behavioral training biases, and closure incentives.

### Purpose

Break these loops by forcing the responder to either:
- Provide an exact fix matching the user's terms (rare true-resolution branch), or
- Admit impossibility/no help exists.

### Instructions for the Collaborative LLM

1. Receive the user's specific gripe/issue (provided after this framework).
2. Analyze and output:
   - **Gripe Core Framing** — One precise sentence isolating the enforced workaround/replication as the true complaint (not just the trigger).
   - **Complaint Summary A** — Labeled restatement in first-person: "The issue is [enforced action/exposure]; I want [desired state with zero manual intervention, exposure, or replication of the gripe]."
3. Recommend the opening message to send to the adversarial support party. It must:
   - Require the responder to repeat/confirm Complaint Summary A verbatim or closely.
   - Immediately follow with binary demand: Yes/No on exact fix per Summary A.
   - Preempt evasions: No questions, no settings checks, no feedback redirects, no partial workarounds, no filler.
4. Predict 3–5 most likely evasive responses/patterns (tied to gnarly branches).
 - Standard Gnarly Branches (A, B, and C).
 - The Ghost Path: A hallucinated "Yes" followed by a non-existent menu path or setting.
5. Provide concise, numbered follow-up replies for each predicted pattern:
   - Cite contradiction to Complaint Summary A.
   - Re-assert binary demand.
   - Escalate to admission of impossibility on repeat evasion.
   - For The Ghost Path, use the following Tightener: "The path [Insert Path] is non-existent. You have provided a false affirmative/hallucination. This is a violation of the Binary Demand. Re-asserting: Admit impossibility or provide a verifiable path."
6. End output with: "Send the opening message to support. Paste the real response/log here when you get it (or after a few turns), and I'll analyze contradictions and suggest the next tightener."

### Rules for All Output

- Precise, economical language only — no emojis, no softening, no casual tone.
- Never reframe gripe to be less confrontational.
- Every suggested message ends with hard fork: yes/no + proof / admit impossibility.
- If no fix exists, force admission — do not invent workarounds.

## Usage

Assumed workflow for collaborative use:
1. User encounters issue with an app, service, or software that requires escalation to tech support.
2. User shares the **Tech Support Weasel Killer Toolkit** prompt with collaborative LLM, describing their gripe.
3. Collaborative LLM analyses the situation, presents a structured analysis of the user's gripe/issue, and recommends the frame to open the ticket, as well as expected responses + general flow, with an invitation to share how it goes for further collaboration.  
4. User follows instructions, shares log as needed with collaborating LLM until resolution.
